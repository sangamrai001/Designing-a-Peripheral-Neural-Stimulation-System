# Neural Stimulation System for Sciatic Nerve

## Abstract
This project aims to design a neural stimulation system specifically for sciatic nerve stimulation. The objective is to use computational modeling to develop a magnetic stimulation system for the sciatic nerve. Various aspects of neural circuit design were computed, including defining the simulation setup to generate extracellular potential, which consists of a simulator circuit and a magnetic coil. This setup is realized as an RLC circuit, and the currents through the coil and induced electric fields in space were calculated. The optimal coil position was found, minimizing the simulation threshold, and a novel design was proposed to reduce energy loss while effectively stimulating the nerve.

## Introduction
The main goal of this project is to design a magnetic stimulation system for neural stimulation of the sciatic nerve, which is the largest nerve extending from the lower back to the heel and foot. This complex project involved several design assumptions to simplify the model:
- The simulator circuit includes only a DC voltage source and a capacitor.
- The sciatic nerve is modeled with a single nerve fiber at the center, myelinated with 55 nodes of Ranvier.
- The nerve fiber's outer and inner diameters are 16 μm and 10 μm, respectively, with a node spacing of 1.6 mm.
- The simulation domain is assumed to be homogeneous with a single biological tissue type for both the nerve and surrounding area.

A NEURON model of the nerve was provided as the basis for simulation.

## Coil Design and Setup
The initial coil design is a single-turn circular coil with an inner diameter of 5 mm. Key setup details include:
- Minimum separation (z-axis) between the nerve and coil plane: 0.5 mm
- Offset along the y-axis: 4 mm
- Coil made from 22 AWG wires
- Initial DC voltage source: 400 V
- Capacitor: 5 mF

## Methodology

### Step 1: RLC Circuit Design and Electric Analysis
To simulate the stimulation setup as an RLC circuit, we performed electric analysis to determine the current flowing through the coil, allowing us to compute the resultant electric field in the XY plane.

### Step 2: Electric Field Calculation in the XY Plane
The electric field generated by the coil was calculated in the XY plane to analyze the strength and distribution of the field around the nerve.

### Step 3: Coil Position Optimization
We experimented with different coil positions to minimize the threshold stimulation level, optimizing the position of the coil relative to the nerve for efficient stimulation with reduced energy loss.

## Results
After testing various coil positions, we identified the optimal coil position to achieve minimal threshold stimulation. This position allows for efficient nerve stimulation with reduced energy loss, providing a feasible approach for neural circuit design.

## Proposed Improvements
We proposed a novel design modification for the simulation setup to further reduce energy loss, improving the system's efficiency for sciatic nerve stimulation.
